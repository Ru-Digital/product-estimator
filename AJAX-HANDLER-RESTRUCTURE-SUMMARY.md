# AJAX Handler Restructuring Summary

## Overview

Successfully restructured the AJAX handlers from 6 scattered handlers to 5 focused handlers, improving organization and maintainability.

## Changes Made

### 1. New Handler Structure

**Before:** 6 handlers with mixed responsibilities
```
- EstimateAjaxHandler (database + session operations)
- RoomAjaxHandler (product operations + validation)
- CustomerAjaxHandler (customer details + contacts)
- FormAjaxHandler (form rendering)
- ProductAjaxHandler (product data)
- SuggestionAjaxHandler (suggestions)
```

**After:** 5 handlers with clear responsibilities
```
- StorageAjaxHandler (all database operations)
- ValidationAjaxHandler (all validation operations)
- UIAjaxHandler (all UI/form rendering)
- ProductAjaxHandler (unchanged - product data)
- SuggestionAjaxHandler (unchanged - suggestions)
```

### 2. Removed Handlers

- **EstimateAjaxHandler**: Endpoints moved to StorageAjaxHandler
- **RoomAjaxHandler**: Validation endpoint moved to ValidationAjaxHandler
- **CustomerAjaxHandler**: Completely removed (unused endpoints)

### 3. Handler Mappings

#### StorageAjaxHandler (NEW)
Consolidated database operations:
- `store_single_estimate` (from EstimateAjaxHandler)
- `check_estimate_stored` (from EstimateAjaxHandler)
- `get_secure_pdf_url` (from EstimateAjaxHandler)
- `request_copy_estimate` (from EstimateAjaxHandler)
- `request_store_contact` (from CustomerAjaxHandler)

#### ValidationAjaxHandler (NEW)
Consolidated validation operations:
- `check_primary_category_conflict` (from RoomAjaxHandler)
- `check_customer_details` (from CustomerAjaxHandler)

#### UIAjaxHandler (RENAMED from FormAjaxHandler)
No changes to endpoints, just renamed for clarity:
- `get_estimate_selection_form`
- `get_new_estimate_form`
- `get_new_room_form`
- `get_room_selection_form`

### 4. Unchanged Handlers

- **ProductAjaxHandler**: All endpoints remain the same
- **SuggestionAjaxHandler**: All endpoints remain the same

### 5. Updated Files

- Created `class-storage-ajax-handler.php`
- Created `class-validation-ajax-handler.php`
- Renamed `class-form-ajax-handler.php` to `class-ui-ajax-handler.php`
- Updated `class-ajax-handler-loader.php` to load new handlers
- Removed obsolete handlers:
  - `class-estimate-ajax-handler.php`
  - `class-room-ajax-handler.php`
  - `class-customer-ajax-handler.php`

## Benefits

1. **Clearer Organization**: Each handler has a single responsibility
2. **Reduced Complexity**: Fewer files to maintain
3. **Better Naming**: Handler names reflect their purpose
4. **Easier Navigation**: Related endpoints grouped together
5. **Improved Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns

## Testing

All JavaScript builds successfully with the new structure. No changes were required in frontend code as endpoints remain the same - only the backend organization changed.
