## Implementation Details

The enhancements were implemented in:

These changes affect all label categories:

## Benefits

These enhancements provide several important benefits:

1. **Improved Administrator Experience**:
   - Administrators can now see exactly where each label is used in the interface
   - Descriptions clearly explain the purpose of each label
   - Context helps administrators make appropriate customizations

2. **Better Maintenance**:
   - Detailed descriptions make the codebase more maintainable
   - New developers can understand the label system more quickly
   - Reduced likelihood of duplicate or conflicting labels

3. **Enhanced Customization**:
   - Store owners can confidently customize labels with clear understanding of impact

4. **Technical Documentation**:

## Next Steps

While this enhancement significantly improves the admin experience, we recommend considering the following next steps:

1. **Add Visual References**: Consider adding screenshot thumbnails to show exactly where labels appear
2. **Create Label Groups**: Group similar labels together for easier management
3. **Add Filtering**: Add advanced filtering capabilities to the labels admin interface
4. **Implement Search**: Add search functionality to quickly find specific labels
5. **Add Context-Specific Help**: Consider adding tooltips or help text specific to each label category
