# Labels System Phase 2 - Next Steps

## Summary of Current Status

We've analyzed the Labels System Phase 2 implementation and found that:

1. The **export functionality** is working correctly.
2. The **import**, **reset category**, and **bulk edit** features are implemented but need testing and potentially minor fixes.
3. **Search functionality** has been removed from the requirements for this phase.
4. There is code duplication between files that should be addressed.

## Immediate Next Steps

### 1. Test the Three Core Features

#### Import Functionality
- Use the "Export Labels" button to create a valid JSON file
- Modify the JSON file (change a few label values)
- Use the "Import Labels" button to import the modified file
- Verify the changes are applied correctly after page refresh

#### Reset Category to Defaults
- Navigate to a specific category tab (e.g., "Buttons")
- Change a few label values
- Click the "Reset Category to Defaults" button
- Confirm the warning dialog
- Verify the labels are reset to their default values

#### Bulk Edit Functionality
- Determine how bulk edit is triggered in the UI
  - This may require examining the admin interface
  - Check for buttons, checkboxes, or other UI elements
- Test the bulk edit workflow once the trigger is identified
- Verify changes are applied correctly

### 2. Address Code Duplication

After confirming which functionality works correctly:

- Remove or consolidate the duplicated code between PHP files
- Remove unused JavaScript file(s)
- Ensure clear documentation of the implementation

### 3. Update Documentation

- Update LABELS-PHASE2-SUMMARY.md to reflect the current state of implementation
- Remove references to search functionality
- Document how to use each feature for administrators

## Technical Recommendations

1. **Focus on LabelSettingsModule.js** as the primary JavaScript implementation
2. **Clarify the bulk edit workflow** and ensure it has a clear entry point in the UI
3. **Consider simplifying the category detection logic** for reset category functionality
4. **Validate nonce handling** across all AJAX operations

## Timeline and Priorities

1. **High Priority:** Test the three core features to confirm functionality
2. **Medium Priority:** Clean up duplicated code and remove unused files
3. **Low Priority:** Improve documentation and admin user experience

By following these steps, we'll ensure the Labels System Phase 2 implementation is complete, functional, and maintainable.
