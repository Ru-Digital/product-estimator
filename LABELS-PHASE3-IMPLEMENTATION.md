## Implementation Notes

- All labels have been implemented in the following files:
  1. Added the labels to the default structure in LabelsMigration in `includes/class-labels-migration.php`
  2. Added descriptions for the labels in the get_label_description() method in `includes/admin/settings/class-labels-settings-module.php`
  3. Added usage mapping information in the get_label_usage() method in `includes/admin/settings/class-labels-settings-module.php`
  4. The Single Product Page "Add to Estimate" button was updated to use the label system in `includes/integration/class-woocommerce-integration.php`
  5. The Product Estimator modal title was updated to use the label system in `public/partials/product-estimator-modal-template.php`
  6. All other labels already existed in the correct format in templates

## Completed Labels

All labels in the implementation list have been implemented.

## Future Enhancements

- Continue to monitor for any additional UI elements that need label implementation
- Consider adding a utility to scan templates for hard-coded text that should be converted to labels
- Develop a guide for developers on how to use the label system for any new interface elements
