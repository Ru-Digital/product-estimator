# PHP Session Handling Removal Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the removal of PHP session handling from the Product Estimator plugin. All session functionality has been replaced with localStorage-based client-side storage.

## JavaScript Changes

### DataService.js Updates

1. **Removed server sync calls for removed endpoints:**
   - `addNewEstimate()` - No longer calls 'add_new_estimate' AJAX endpoint
   - `addNewRoom()` - No longer calls 'add_new_room' AJAX endpoint
   - `removeRoom()` - No longer calls 'remove_room' AJAX endpoint  
   - `removeEstimate()` - No longer calls 'remove_estimate' AJAX endpoint

2. **Methods now only handle localStorage operations:**
   - All methods resolve immediately after local storage updates
   - No asynchronous server sync for these operations
   - Comments updated to reflect localStorage-only approach

### AjaxService.js Updates

1. **Removed methods for unused endpoints:**
   - `addNewEstimate()` - Completely removed
   - `addNewRoom()` - Completely removed
   - `removeRoom()` - Completely removed
   - `removeEstimate()` - Completely removed

2. **These endpoints are no longer available:**
   - 'add_new_estimate'
   - 'add_new_room'
   - 'remove_room'
   - 'remove_estimate'

## PHP Changes

### Removed Endpoints (Already Done)

The following AJAX endpoints have already been removed from their respective handlers:
- EstimateAjaxHandler:
  - get_estimates_list
  - get_estimates_data
  - add_new_estimate
  - remove_estimate
  - check_estimates_exist

- RoomAjaxHandler:
  - get_rooms_for_estimate
  - add_new_room
  - remove_room

### Remaining PHP Session References

1. **SessionDebugHelper** (`includes/class-session-debug-helper.php`)
   - This file still contains session references but appears to be orphaned
   - Recommended action: Remove this file as it's no longer used

2. **SessionHandler** (`includes/class-session-handler.php`)
   - If this file exists, it should be removed as it's no longer used

## Impact

1. All estimate and room data is now managed exclusively in localStorage
2. Server-side session storage has been completely eliminated
3. Better performance due to reduced server calls
4. Improved user experience with instant local updates

## Recommendations

1. Remove `class-session-debug-helper.php` file
2. Remove `class-session-handler.php` file if it exists
3. Remove any remaining session-related test files
4. Update documentation to reflect localStorage-only approach
