############################################
#  Estimate Management
############################################
Feature: Estimate management
  As a customer using the Product Estimator
  I want to create and review estimates
  So that I can group rooms and products under a single quote

  @critical
  Scenario: Create the first estimate
    Given no estimates exist in local storage or the PHP session
    When I open the site header and click the "Estimate" link
    And I enter "Kitchen Reno" as the estimate name
    And I enter "4000" as the postcode
    And I press the "Create Estimate" button
    Then an estimate named "Kitchen Reno" should be stored in local storage
    And the "Add Room" form should be displayed

  Scenario: Validate postcode on estimate creation
    Given no estimates exist in local storage or the PHP session
    When I open the "Estimate" link
    And I leave the postcode field blank
    And I press "Create Estimate"
    Then a validation message "Postcode required" should appear
    And no estimate should be stored in local storage

############################################
#  Create an estimate when one already exists
############################################
Feature: Create an estimate when one already exists
  A customer should be able to add a second estimate via the standard
  "Estimate" entry-point without overwriting or hiding the first one.

  @critical
  Scenario: Add a second estimate from the Estimates screen
    Given an estimate named "Kitchen Reno" with postcode "4000" is stored and visible in the Estimates list
    When I click the site header "Estimate" link
    And the Estimates list is displayed
    And I press the "New Estimate" button
    And I enter "Bathroom Reno" as the estimate name
    And I enter "4000" as the postcode
    And I press "Create Estimate"
    Then an estimate card titled "Bathroom Reno" should appear in the Estimates list
    And the existing estimate "Kitchen Reno" card should still be present
    And the UI should indicate that "Bathroom Reno" is the currently selected estimate

  Scenario: New estimate appears in selector dropdown
    Given the two estimates "Kitchen Reno" and "Bathroom Reno" exist
    When I open the estimate selector dropdown
    Then the dropdown should list exactly two options: "Kitchen Reno" and "Bathroom Reno"

############################################
#  Multi-estimate / multi-room coverage
############################################
Feature: Working with multiple estimates and rooms
  A customer can manage several estimates, each with its own rooms and products,
  without data leaking between them.

  @critical
  Scenario: Create two separate estimates
    Given no estimates exist
    When I create an estimate named "Kitchen Reno" with postcode "4000"
    And I create another estimate named "Bathroom Reno" with postcode "4000"
    Then both estimates should be listed in the Estimates screen
    And each estimate should have 0 rooms

  @critical
  Scenario: Add distinct rooms to each estimate
    Given an estimate "Kitchen Reno" exists
    And an estimate "Bathroom Reno" exists

    And I add a room named "Kitchen" sized 4 Ã— 5 m
    And I switch to estimate "Bathroom Reno"
    And I add a room named "Bathroom" sized 3 Ã— 2 m
    Then "Kitchen Reno" should contain exactly 1 room called "Kitchen"
    And "Bathroom Reno" should contain exactly 1 room called "Bathroom"

  Scenario: Totals remain independent
    Given "Kitchen Reno" has a room "Kitchen" with product A priced $100
    And "Bathroom Reno" has a room "Bathroom" with product B priced $200
    When I view the estimate totals
    Then the total for "Kitchen Reno" should be $100
    And the total for "Bathroom Reno" should be $200

  Scenario: Duplicate room names across estimates are allowed
    Given estimate "Build A" exists
    And estimate "Build B" exists
    When I add a room named "Living Room" to "Build A"
    And I add a room named "Living Room" to "Build B"
    Then "Build A" should list one room named "Living Room"
    And "Build B" should list one room named "Living Room"
    And the rooms should have different room IDs

  Scenario: Removing a room in one estimate does not affect others
    Given each estimate "Kitchen Reno" and "Bathroom Reno" contains exactly one room
    When I remove the room from "Kitchen Reno" and confirm
    Then "Kitchen Reno" should have 0 rooms
    And "Bathroom Reno" should still have 1 room

  Scenario: Switching estimates preserves selected context
    Given I have estimates "Project 1" and "Project 2"
    And I am viewing the rooms of "Project 1"
    When I switch to "Project 2" via the estimate selector
    Then the room list should show only rooms belonging to "Project 2"

    And I select the estimate "Kitchen Reno"
    And I enter "Kitchen" for room name, "4" for width, "5" for length

  Each estimate maintains its own set of rooms in UI and storage.

  Scenario: Verify rooms do not bleed between estimates
    Given "Kitchen Reno" contains rooms "Kitchen" and "Dining"
    And "Bathroom Reno" contains no rooms
    When I switch the estimate selector to "Bathroom Reno"
